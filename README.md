# EveryThing-DataDomain

An exploration of different terms that are used and encountered when talking about 'Data'. This is based on my personal understanding and may differ from their formal definitions.

## Data & Information
    I believe, fact and data are the same. Fact is any experienced 'event'. Data is recorded form of that event. 
    Data becomes Information when given a context. Information conveys something more about Data, allowing 
    the user to draw out knowledge. Whether the knowledge is useful or not again depends on other things - 
    ability of the user, relevant to current problem etc.
    
  ### example
      10 32 Betty Cereal 12.00 
    
      The above is an example of Data. We understand, based on what we already know, that one of the data point is
      a 'name' and other is 'a food article'. Beyond this, it's very difficult to derive any more meaning. Given 
      the context, however, this becomes information. (The time customer came into store to buy something and the 
      price of that something)
    
    There are different ways in which data can be organised.Relational, Graph, Geo-spatial are some of the 
    present ways of oranising data.
